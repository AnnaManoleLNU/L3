### NF 1 - usability

1.1 The game is easy to understand and play. <br>
The game was shown to 2 users who were not familiar with the game. They were able to understand the game and play it without any help. However, both users expressed concern about the original game difficulties medium (6 colors) and hard (9 colors). They found it difficult to remember the sequence of colors, given the time limit of 5 seconds, especially since the colors can get slumped to be the very similar. Thus the decision was made to change the medium difficulty to 4 colors and the hard difficulty to 5 colors.

1.2 The game is visually appealing. <br>
The 2 users that tested the game were asked to give their opinions of the game's overall visuals. They found it visually appealing. No rating or scale was used to measure the visual appeal of the game.
