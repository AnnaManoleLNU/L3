This is a memory game application with colors, where the user has to remember the a color sequence and repeat it. The user is given 5 seconds to memorize the sequence and after that recreate it. Difficulties available are easy (3 color tiles), medium (4 color tiles) and hard (5 color tiles). The game is over when the user fails to recreate the sequence.
